# AI System for Customer Support Call Evaluation

An end-to-end agentic AI system that automatically evaluates customer support calls and generates personalized coaching feedback for agents — replacing manual, subjective quality assurance with a fully automated, explainable pipeline.

---

## The Problem

Current customer support evaluation suffers from:
- Manual quality assurance that is costly and slow
- Subjective and inconsistent scoring
- Limited call sampling — only a fraction of calls get reviewed
- No automatic policy compliance verification
- Lack of structured coaching for agents

---

## What the System Does

When a call ends, the system automatically:

1. **Transcribes** the call audio and identifies who is speaking (agent vs customer)
2. **Extracts behavioral metrics** — talking ratio, interruptions, silences, number of turns
3. **Evaluates the call using deep learning:**
   - Customer sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative) across the call
   - Agent opening and closing compliance
   - Issue type classification (78 banking categories)
4. **Validates agent resolution** against company policy using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
5. **Computes a final performance score** using weighted metrics
6. **Generates a coaching report** with strengths, areas for improvement, and suggested alternative phrasing

### Completed Highlights

**Phase 3C — Issue Classification**
- Architecture: Dual-head RoBERTa (shared encoder, two classification heads)
- Coarse head: 10 banking categories | Fine head: 78 issue classes
- Accuracy: 91.33% on BANKING77 test set
- Model on HuggingFace: [Mohamed-Makram47/banking-issue-classifier](https://huggingface.co/Mohamed-Makram47/banking-issue-classifier)

**Phase 4 — RAG Policy Validation**
- 78 FAISS indexes pre-built, one per issue type
- Manuals grounded in real Banking77 customer utterances (10 examples per class)
- Embedding model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers)
- Call-level evaluation: single LLM call per conversation with deduplicated policy retrieval

**Phase 5 — Scoring + Coaching Generation**
- Aggregates RAG verdicts into a per-call compliance score
- LLM generates structured coaching reports per call:
  - Policy violations with explanation
  - Agent strengths
  - Suggested alternative phrasing for failed interactions
